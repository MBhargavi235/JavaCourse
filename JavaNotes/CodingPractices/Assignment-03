1.Honor Student

In a school, the students are divided into two categories based on their ranks. Students whose rank is less than 10 are considered as
HONOR STUDENT and all others are considered as NORMAL STUDENT . Based on the rank, find to which category a student belongs.

Input
The first line of input is an integer.

Explanation
In the given example, rank = 9 . As the rank is less than 10, the student is considered an honor student. So the output should be HONOR STUDENT

Sample Input1
1
Output 
HONOR STUDENT

Sample Input1
15
Output 
NORMAL STUDENT

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        if(a<10){
            System.out.println("HONOR STUDENT");
        }
        else{
           System.out.println("NORMAL STUDENT"); 
        }
    }
}

2.Positive or Negative

A number N is given as input. Write a program to check if N positive or negative.

Input
Given an number (float) N as input.

Output
The output should be a string that can be either Positive or Negative

Explanation
In the given example N = -12.5 . As the value of N is less than O, the output should be Negative .

Sample Input1
-12.5
Output 
Negative

Sample Input2
15.2
Output 
Positive

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        float a=input.nextFloat();
        if(a>0){
            System.out.println("Positive");
        }
        else{
           System.out.println("Negative"); 
        }
    }
}

3. Increment the number

Write a program to increment N by 5, if N is greater than 10, otherwise by 1.

Input
The first line of input is an integer N
.
Output
Print the output obtained after performing operations as mentioned above.

Explanation
For example, if the value of N is 3 as it is less than 10, The N value increments by 1. So the output should be 4.

Sample Input1
3
Output 
4

Sample Input2
63
Output 
68

Solution 

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        if(a>10){
            System.out.println(a+5);
        }
        else{
           System.out.println(a+1); 
        }
    }
}

4. Relation b/w Numbers

Write a program to print the relation between two numbers, X and Y.

Input
The first line has an integer X. The second line has an integer Y.

Output
Print X<Y if X is less than Y otherwise, print X >= Y.

Explanation
Given X = 2 ,Y = 5 As 2 <5 (X<Y) So the output should be X<Y

Sample Input1
2
5
Output
X < Y 

Sample Input2
5
2 
Output
x >=Y

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        int b=input.nextInt();
   
        if(a<b){
         System.out.println("X < Y");   
        }
     
        else{
           System.out.println("X >= Y"); 
        }
    }
}

5.Sum or Product

Write a program to print the sum of two numbers, A and B . If their sum is less than 10, otherwise print the product of numbers.

Input
The first line is an integer A. The second line is an integer B.

Output
The output should be an integer.

Explanation
A = 1, B = 2 . Their sum is 2 + 1 In the given example which is less than 10.
So, the output should be 3.

Sample Input1
1
2
Output
3

Sample Input2
42
10
Output
420

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        int b=input.nextInt();
   
        if(a+b<10){
         System.out.println(a+b);   
        }
     
        else{
           System.out.println(a*b); 
        }
    }
}

6. Smallest Among 3 Numbers

Write a program to print the smallest value among the three numbers A, B, and C.

Input
The first line is an integer A. The second line is an integer B. The third line is an integer C.

Explanation
In the given values A = 6, B = 5, C = 4 . 4 is the smallest value among the three. So the output should be 4.

Sample Input1
6
5
4
Output
4

Sample Input2
-10000
-10000
-10000
Output
-10000

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        int b=input.nextInt();
        int c=input.nextInt();
        if(a<b&&a<c){
         System.out.println(a);   
        }
        else if(b<c){
            System.out.println(b); 
        }
        else{
           System.out.println(c); 
        }
    }
