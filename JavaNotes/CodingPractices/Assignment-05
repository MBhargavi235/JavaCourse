(1 - Monday, 2 - Tuesday, 3 - Wednesday, 4 - Thursday, 5 - Friday, 6 - Saturday, 7 - Sunday)

Input
The first line of input is an integer D.

Output
The output should be a string representing the day name.

Explanation
For example, if D = 3 then, according to the day number, the day should be Wednesday .

Sample Input2
2 
Tuesday

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        if(a==1){
            System.out.println("Monday");
        }
        else if(a==2){
            System.out.println("Tuesday");
        }
        else if(a==3){
            System.out.println("Wednesday");
        }
        else if(a==4){
            System.out.println("Thursday");
        }
        else if(a==5){
            System.out.println("Friday");
        }
        else if(a==6){
            System.out.println("Saturday");
        }
        else{
           System.out.println("Sunday");
        }
    }
}

2.Relation between two numbers 2

Write a program to print the relation between two numbers, A and B.

Input
The first line is an integer A. 
The second line is an integer B.

Output
Print A == B if A and B are equal.
Print A>B if A is greater than B.
Print A<B if A is less than B.

Explanation
Given A = 3, B = 4 As 3 < 4, the output should be A<B.

Sample Input1
3
4
Output
A < B

Sample Input2
4
4
A == B

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        int b=input.nextInt();
        if(a==b){
            System.out.println("A == B");
        }
        else if(a>b){
            System.out.println("A > B");
        }
        else{
           System.out.println("A < B");
        }
    }
}

3.Profit or Loss

The amount at which a product is sold by the seller is known as the Selling Price. The amount at which the seller has acquired the product is known as the Cost Price.
If the Selling Price of a product is higher than its cost price, then the seller has made a profit. If it is lesser, then the seller has incurred loss selling that 
product. If the Selling Price is equal to the Cost Price, it means the seller has made No Profit and No loss, by selling the product.
Given Cost price CP and selling price SP of a product, write a program to determine whether the seller made a profit, incurred loss, or made no profit or loss.

Input
The first line is an integer CP. The second line is an integer SP.

Output
Print Profit or Loss or No Profit - No Loss based on CP and SP.

Explanation
In the given example CP=143, SP=155, So as the selling price is higher than the cost price, the output should be Profit.

Sample Input1
143
155
Output
Profit

Sample Input2
165
125
Output
Loss

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int cp=input.nextInt();
        int sp=input.nextInt();
        if(sp>cp){
            System.out.println("Profit");
        }
        else if(sp<cp){
            System.out.println("Loss");
        }
        else{
           System.out.println("No Profit - No Loss");
        }
    }
}

4. Weather condition

Write a program to display a customized message based on temperature T.

Input
The first line is a real number T.

Output
Print Freezing weather if T< 0 Print Very Cold weather if 0 <= T < 10 Print Cold weather if 10 <= T < 20 Print Normal 
if 20 <= T < 30 Print Hot if 30 <= T < 40 Print Very Hotif T >= 40.

Explanation
In the given example, the temperature is -50.0 . As the temperature is less than 0 , the output should be Freezing weather.

Sample Input1
-50.0 
Output
Freezing weather

Sample Input2
5.7
Output
Very Cold weather

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        float t=input.nextFloat();
        if(t<0){
            System.out.println("Freezing weather");
        }
        else if(t>=0 && t<10){
            System.out.println("Very Cold weather");
        }
        else if(t>=10 && t<20){
            System.out.println("Cold weather");
        }
        else if(t>=20 && t<30){
            System.out.println("Normal");
        }
        else if(t>=30 && t<40){
            System.out.println("Hot");
        }
        else{
           System.out.println("Very Hot");
        }
    }
}

5.Leap Year

Write a program to determine whether the given year Y is a leap year or not.
A normal year consists of 365 days. But the time required for Earth to revolve around the Sun is around 365.2425 days. So a "leap year" of 366 days 
is used once every four years to eliminate the error caused by three normal (but short) years. Any year that is divisible by 4 is usually a leap year:
for example, 1988, 1992, and 1996 are leap years.
However, there is still a small error that must be accounted for. To eliminate this error, the calendar considers that a year that is divisible by 100 
(for example, 1900) is a leap year only if it is also divisible by 400. For this reason, the following years are not leap years:
1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600, ... This is because they are divisible by 100 but not by 400.
The following years are leap years: 1600, 2000, 2400 This is because they are divisible by both 100 and 400.

Input 
The first line is an integer 

Output
The output should be a single line containing True if it satisfies the given conditions, False in all other cases.

Explanation
In the given example Y=2016, the year 2016 is a leap year.
So the output should be True 

Sample Input1
2016
Output
True

Sample Input2
1800
Output
False

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a =input.nextInt();
        if(a%100==0 && a%400==0){
            System.out.println("True");
        }
        else if(a%4==0 && a%100!=0){
            System.out.println("True");
        }
        else{
           System.out.println("False");
        }
    }
}
