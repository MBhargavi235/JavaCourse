1.Maximum number of Handshakes

It was Raj's first day of school. His teacher Anu asked the students to meet every other student in the 
class and to introduce themselves. The teacher asked them to do handshakes when they meet each other.
If there are N number of students in the class then write a program to print the total number of handshakes
made by the students.

Input
The first line is a single integer N.

Output
Prin the value representing total number of handshakes.

Explanation
In the given example there are 5 persons.
The first person shakes his hand with 4 persons. 
The second person then shakes his hand with 3 persons.
The third person shakes his hand with 2 persons. 
The fourth person shakes his hand with 1 person.
From this, the number of handshakes = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1
So, the output should be 10.

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        int b=a*(a-1)/2;
        System.out.println(b);
    }
}
