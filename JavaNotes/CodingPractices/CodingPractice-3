7.Valid Traingle

Given three angles of a traingle, write a program to check whether the traingle is valid or not.
A traingle is valid if the sum of its three angles is equal to 180 degrees.

Input 
The first line of input will contain the first angle of the traingle.
The second line of input will contain the second angle of the traingle.
The third line of input will contain the third angle of the traingle.

Ouput
If the sum of its three angles is equal to 180, print It's a Triangle.
In all other cases print It's not a Triangle.

Explanation
For Example, if the first angle is 80, the second angle is 90, and the third angle is 100. Therefore
the sum of three angles (80+90+100) is 270, which is not equal to 180. So the output should be 
It's not a Triangle.
Similarly, if the first angle is 60, the second angle is 60, and the third angle is 60. Therefore
the sum of three angles (60+60+60) is 180, which is not equal to 180. So the output should be 
It's a Triangle.

Sample Input1
80
90
100
Output 
It's not a Triangle

Sample Input2
60
60
60
Output
It's a Triangle

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        int b=input.nextInt();
        int c=input.nextInt();
        String res =(a+b+c==180)?"It's a Triangle":"It's not a Triangle";
        System.out.println(res);
        input.close();
    }
}

8. Valid Triangle-2

Given the lengths of three sides of triangle, write a program to check whether a valid triangle
can be formed or not with the sides of given lengths.
For a triangle to be valid, the sum of lengths of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than 
the third side.

Input
The first line of input will contain the first side of triangle.
The second line of input will contain the second side of triangle.
The third line of input will contain the third side of triangle.

Ouput
If the sides can form a valid triangle 180, print It's a Triangle.
In all other cases print It's not a Triangle.

Explanation
For Example, if the first side is 4, the second side is 5, and the third side is 3, then
the sum of every two sides is greater than the third side:
4+5>3
5+3>4
3+4>5
So the output should be It's a Triangle.

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        int b=input.nextInt();
        int c=input.nextInt();
        String res=(a+b>c&&b+c>a&&c+a>b)?"It's a Triangle":"It's not a Triangle";
        System.out.println(res);
        input.close();
    }
