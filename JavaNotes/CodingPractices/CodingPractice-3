1.Greatest Among Two Numbers

Write a program to print the greatest among the two numbers. 

Input 
The first line of input contains a number.
the second line of input contains a number.

Output
The output should be a single line containing the greatest among the two numbers.

Explanation
For example, if the given numbers are 4 and 3, your code should print the greatest number which is 4.

Sample Input1
4
3
Output:
4

Sample Input2:
7
5
Output
7

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        int b=input.nextInt();
        int res=(a>b)?a:b;
            System.out.println(res);
    }
}

2.Equal Numbers

Write a program to check if the given two numbers are equal. 

Input 
The first line of input contains a number.
the second line of input contains a number.

Output
If the given numbers are equal, print "Equal". In all other cases, print "Not Equal".

Explanation
For example, if the first number is 5 and the second number is 5. Since both the given numbers are equal. So the output should be "Equal".
Whereas, if the first number is 10 and the second number is 5, both the numbers are not equal. So the output should be "Not Equal".

Sample Input1
5
5
Output:
Equal

Sample Input2:
10
5
Output
Not Equal

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        int b=input.nextInt();
        String res=(a==b)?"Equal":"Not Equal";
            System.out.println(res);
        input.close();
    }
}

3. Positive or Negative

Write a program to find if the given number is positive, negative or zero. 

Input 
The first line of input contains a number.

Output
If the given number is greater than zero, print "Positive".
If the given number is less than zero, print "Negative".
If the given number is equal to zero, print "Zero".

Explanation
For example, if the given number is -12 which is less than zero. So the output should be Negative.
Similarly, if the given number is 15, which is greater than zero. So the output should be Positive.

Sample Input1
-12
Output:
Negative

Sample Input2:
15
Output
Positive

Sample Input3
0
Output
Zero

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        if(a>0){
            System.out.println("Positive");
        }
        else if(a<0){
            System.out.println("Negative");
        }
        else{
           System.out.println("Zero"); 
        }
    }
}

4. Vote eligiblity

A person is eligible to vote if his/her age at least 18 years. Write a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on the person's age. 

Input 
The input will be a number denoting the person's age in years.

Output
If the person's age is at least 18, print Eligible.
In all other cases, print Not Eligible.

Explanation
A person is eligible to vote if his/her is 18 years or above .
For example, if the person's age is 15, which is below 18. So the output should be Not Eligible.
Whereas if the person's age is 21, which is above 18. So the output should be Eligible.

Sample Input1
15
Output:
Not Eligible

Sample Input2:
21
Output
Eligible

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        String res=(a>=18)?"Eligible":"Not Eligible";
            System.out.println(res);
        input.close();
    }
}

5. Square or Reactangle

Given the length and breadth of a box, check if it is a Reactangle or Square. 

Input 
The first line of input will contain the length of the box.
The second line of input will contain the breadth of the box.

Output
If the given length and breadth are equal, print Square.
In all other cases, print Reactangle.

Explanation
For example, if the given length is 6, and the given breadth is 6, the length and breadth
are equal.So the output should be Square.
Similarly if the given length is 5, and the given breadth is 10, the length and breadth
are not equal.So the output should be Reactangle.

Sample Input1
6
6
Output:
Square

Sample Input2:
5
10
Output
Rectangle

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        int b=input.nextInt();
        String res =(a==b)?"Square":"Rectangle";
        System.out.println(res);
        input.close();
    }
}

6. Bonus Salary

A Company decided to give bonus of 5% to an employee if his/her years of service is more than five years. 
Write a program that reads an employee's salary and years of service and decides whether the employee gets the bonus or not.

Input 
The first line of input will contain the salary of an employee.
The second line of input will contain years of service.

Output
If the employee gets a bonus, print the net bonus amount.
If the employee doesn't get the bonus, No Bonus.

Explanation
For example, if the employee's salary is 25000 and years of experience is 3. As the years of experienceis less than 5, the output should be No Bonus.
Similarly if the employee's salary is 50000 and years of experience is 6, As the years of experienceis more than 5, the employee is eligible for the bonus. 
BY computing the 5% of his salary, the net bonus amount should be 2500.0

Sample Input1
25000
3
Output:
No Bonus

Sample Input2:
50000
6
Output
2500.0

Solution:

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        int b=input.nextInt();
        if(b>5){
            float newSal=(float)(0.05*a);
            System.out.println(newSal);
        }
        else{
           System.out.println("No bonus"); 
        }
        input.close();
    }
}
