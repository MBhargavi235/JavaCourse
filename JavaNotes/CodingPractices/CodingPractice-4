1.Even or Odd 

Write a program to check if the given number is even or odd.

Input 
The input will be a single line containing an integer.

Output
If the given number is even, print Even. If it is odd, print Odd.

Explanation
For example, if the given number is 4, which is divisible by 2, the output should be Even.
For example, if the given number is 3, which is not divisible by 2, the output should be Odd.

Sample Input1
4
Output
Even

Sample Input2
3
Output
Odd

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        String res=(a%2==0)?"Even":"Odd";
        System.out.println(res);   
        input.close();
    }
}

2.Special Eleven 

A number is called Special Even, if it is a multiple of 11 or if it is one more than a multiple of 11. 
Write a program to check if the given number is a Special Eleven.

Input 
The input will be a single line containing an integer.

Output
If the given input satifies the above conitions, print Special Eleven. In all other cases print Normal Number.

Explanation
For example, if the given number is 22, which is multiple of 11, the output should be Special Eleven.
For example, if the given number is 15, which does not satisfy any of the conditions, the output should be Normal Number.

Sample Input1
22
Output
Special Eleven

Sample Input2
23
Output
Special Eleven

Sample Input3
15
Output
Normal Number

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        String res=(a%11==0 || a%11==1)?"Special Eleven":"Normal Number";
        System.out.println(res);   
        input.close();
    }
}

3.Special Number

Write a program to read a single line of input, which is two-digit integer and Print Special Number
if any one of the following conditions are satisfied 
1.The sum of digits is 7
2.One of the digits is 7
3.The number is a multiple of 7
Print Normal Number in all other cases

Input 
The first line of input contains a two-digit integer.

Output
If the given input satisfies the above conditions, print Special Number. In all other cases Normal Number.

Explanation
For example, if the given two-digit integer is 67. As one of its digits is 7, the output should be Special Number.
whereas, if the given two-digit integer is 36. As it does not satisfy any of the above conditions, the output should be Normal Number.

Sample Input1
67
Output
Special Number

Sample Input2
36
Output
Normal Number

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        String student=((a/10+a%10==7)||(a%7==0)||(a/10==7) ||(a%10==7))?"Special Number":"Normal Number";
        System.out.println(student);   
        input.close();
    }
}

/*
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        String a=input.nextLine();
        String a1=String.valueOf(a.charAt(0));
        String a2=String.valueOf(a.charAt(1));
        int b=Integer.parseInt(a);
        int b1=Integer.parseInt(a1);
        int b2=Integer.parseInt(a2);
        if(b%7==0||b1+b2==7||(b1==7) ||(b2==7)){
         System.out.println("Special Number");   
        }
        else{
           System.out.println("Normal Number"); 
        }
    }
}

4.Lucky Number-2

Write a program to print if the given number is divisible by any of the lucky numbers 6,3,2 in 
decreasing order of priority (6 is luckier than 3 is 3 is luckier than 2).

Print Number is divisible by followed by the luckiest number among the above 3 which can divide the number.
Print Number is not divisible by 2,3 or 6 if the number is not divisible by any of them.

Input 
The input while be a single line containing a positive number.

Output
If the given number is divisible by 6, print Number is divisible by 6
If the given number is divisible by 3, print Number is divisible by 3
If the given number is divisible by 2, print Number is divisible by 2
In all other cases print Number is not divisible by 2,3 or 6.

Explanation
In the example 126 is divisible by 2,3 or 6 
But 6 takes precedence because 6 is luckiest among the three. So the output should be the Number is divisible by 6.

Sample Input1
126
Output
Number is divisible by 6 

Sample Input2
27
Output
Number is divisible by 3

Sample Input1
55
Output
Number is not divisible by 2,3 or 6

Solution

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Write your code here
        Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=input.nextInt();
        if(a%6==0){
         System.out.println("Number is divisible by 6");   
        }
       else if(a%3==0){
         System.out.println("Number is divisible by 3");   
        }
         else if(a%2==0){
         System.out.println("Number is divisible by 2");   
        }
        else{
           System.out.println("Number is not divisible by 2, 3 or 6"); 
        }
    }
}
